**Question**: Does a current customer drop in the platinum trial license key into their current SS instance to receive the connection manager feature?

**Answer**: Yes, if the platinum trial license was created recently.

 

**Question**: Does it matter if Connection Manager is working with a different SS instance than the one aligned to the trial key?

**Answer**: If the SS instance has that internal flag set from a Platinum Trial, it should be fine.



**Question**: Is it okay to add trial license to prod server? Will it overwrite or add to the current license?

**Answer**: It should add and run alongside the current license. While the Trial is active, they will have access to SS Platinum level features, but once the trial expires, they will revert to their existing license.

# Introduction to Connection Manager

Connection Manager (CM) is a program for initiating and maintaining one or more connections from a computer desktop to remote servers or processes using standard remote protocols such as Windows Remote Desk Protocol (RDP) and Unix Secure SHell (SSH).

It marks an expansion of Thycoticâ€™s product line to include remote connectivity tools closely integrated with Secret Server. It permits technical staff to quickly access resources using the convenience of a familiar, rich desktop interface while maintaining all the safeguards and workflows included with Secret Server.

This manual includes instructions for installing and using Connection Manager as a stand-alone product or in conjunction with a Secret Server installation.

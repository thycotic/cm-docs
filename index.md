# Introduction to Connection Manager

With Thycotic Connection Manager, IT teams can launch ad-hoc connections to manage sessions with remote resources, navigating Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Unix Secure SHell (SSH) connection protocols as needed. Management of multiple active sessions is easy. You can store and organize connections by adding them to your favorites and import any folder structure or connections used in other tools for a single management hub.

It marks an expansion of Thycoticâ€™s product line to include remote connectivity tools closely integrated with Secret Server. It permits technical staff to quickly access resources using the convenience of a familiar, rich desktop interface while maintaining all the safeguards and workflows included with Secret Server.

This manual includes instructions for installing and using Connection Manager as a stand-alone product or in conjunction with a Secret Server installation.

# Install Connection Manager 

Connection Manager is a desktop client application that can be downloaded and installed on Windows and Mac machines. While the client application does not need to be installed in the same location as Secret Server, if users are planning to use the Secret Server integration, the machine that Connection Manager is installed on must be able to reach Secret Server.

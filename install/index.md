# Install Connection Manager

Connection Manager is a desktop client application that can be downloaded and installed on Windows and Mac machines. While the client application does not need to be installed in the same location as Secret Server, if users are planning to use the Secret Server integration, the machine on which Connection Manager is installed must be able to reach Secret Server. Connection Manager creates a local encrypted file storage for saving local connections and Secure Server(s) connectivity information.

For details on the installation of Connection Manager, please follow the below procedures:

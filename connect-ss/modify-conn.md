# Modify a Connection

Existing connections to Secret Server can be modified. Most fields can be modified except for the Secret Server URL field:

1. On the Configuration menu, select **Secret Server Connections**. The Secret Server Connections window opens.

2. Click **Edit** next to the Secret Server connection to be modified. The Edit text is between the Connection name and the URL value. The Connection dialog box opens.

3. Make any desired changes in Step 1 and click **Connect**.

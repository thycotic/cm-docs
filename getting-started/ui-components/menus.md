# Menus

There are several menu types available within the user interface:

## Stack Menu

The menu ![](images/menus.png) at the top left of the application allows you to:

- Create new connections (RDP or SSH)

- Create new folders

- Delete folders

- Delete connections

- Exit the application

**NOTE:** The Stack menu is context sensitive so the available, displayed options depend on what is currently selected in the navigation tree or the main work area.

## Right Click Navigation Menu

Right clicking a folder allows you to:

- Create new folders

- Create new connections

- Delete folders

- Export and Import connections

- Collapse and Expand Secret Server connections and Local connections

## Work Area Menu

Right clicking the work area allows you to:

- Create new folders

- Create new connections (RDP or SSH)

## Search

In the upper right corner of Connections, Local Connections, and Secret Server Connections windows there is a search box. A normal search action will only look within the currently selected folder. This search bar will act as a global search in some cases.

## Global Search

The global search option is only available at the top-level node for a Secret Server connection, or if the Local Connections node is selected in the navigation bar. Global search is available in the top right corner of the work area and will perform a search through the entire selected connection.

For example, if a user selects the top level of a Secret Server connection and then performs a search, the search will look through the entire Secret Server connection for the value, but it will not look through the Local Connections or any other Secret Server connections. If a user instead selects their personal folder or a sub-folder within the connection, the search will be limited to only the selected folder.

## Configuration

Located at the bottom left of the application screen, the Configuration button allows users to set up and control various aspects of the application.

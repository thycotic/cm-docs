# Create a Password

When Connection Manager is launched for the first time, or if no file storage is detected, you must create a secure password for this vault.

>**Important**: If this password is lost, the saved connections are not recoverable and will have to be re-entered.

1. Enter the __local password__ and start the application. The following window opens.

   ![local password](images/create-storage-for-conns.png "Create Storage for Connections by entering local password")

2. Enter the __password__ to start the application.

3. Confirm the password and click __Create__.

>**Note**: If a local storage file exists but a user wishes to create a new one, click __Create new local storage file link__ at the bottom left of the window. This will overwrite any existing storage file and any data stored there.

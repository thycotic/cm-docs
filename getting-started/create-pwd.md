# Create a Password

When Connection Manager is launched for the first time, or if no file storage is detected, you must create a secure password for this vault.

**Important**: If this password is lost, the saved connections are not recoverable and will have to be re-entered.

1. Enter the **local password** and start the application. The following window opens.

2. Enter the **password** to start the application.

3. Reenter to confirm password and click **Create**.

   **Note**: If a local storage file exists but a user wishes to create a new one, click **Create new local storage file link** at the bottom left of the window. This will overwrite any existing storage file and any data stored there.

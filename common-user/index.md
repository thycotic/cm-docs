# Common User Activities

Since there are many variations and configuration options for remote connectivity, it is not possible to cover all of them in detail. However, Connection Manager does support many variations.

* [Create, edit or delete a folder](folder.md)
* [Connection to Remote Systems](../common-user/connections/remote-conn/index.md)
* [Integrated Connections](../common-user/connections/integrated-conn/index.md)
* Reauthenticate to Secret Server - When the application starts, any configured Secret Server connection will be displayed but __not__ connected. 
To re-authenticate the Secret Server connection, double-click the __closed-lock icon__ in the navigation tree, or right-click and select __Connect__.

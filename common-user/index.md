# Common User Activities

Since there are many variations and configuration options for remote connectivity, it is not possible to cover all of them in detail. However, Connection Manager does support many of these variations. Feel free to explore further and if you have additional questions please [contact support](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/contactsupport).

* [Create, edit or delete a folder](folder.md)

* [Connection to Remote Systems](../common-user/connections/remote-conn/index.md)

* [Integrated Connections](../common-user/connections/integrated-conn/index.md)

* **Reauthenticate to Secret Server**

   When the application starts, any configured Secret Server connection will be displayed but **not** connected.

   To re-authenticate the Secret Server connection, double-click the **closed-lock icon** in the navigation tree, or right-click and select **Connect**.

## Does a current customer drop in the platinum trial license key into their current Secret Server instance to receive the connection manager feature?

Yes, if the platinum trial license was created recently.

## Does it matter, if Connection Manager is working with a different Secret Server instance than the one aligned with the trial key?

Connection Manager can connect to any Secret Server instance that is licensed with the Connection Manager Add-on license for Secret Server.

## Is it okay to add trial license to production server? Will it overwrite or add to the current license?

It should add and run alongside the current license. While the Trial is active, they will have access to Secret Server Platinum level features, but once the trial expires, they will revert to their existing license.

# Remove a Folder

When a folder is removed, the folder, and its contents (Local connections and other folders) are deleted. This action is NOT reversible. Once a connection is deleted it cannot be recovered.

1. Navigate to **the folder to be deleted**.

2. Right-click the **folder name** and select **Delete**. A confirmation window will open.

# Modify a Connection

Existing connections to Secret Server can be modified. Most fields can be modified except for the **Secret Server URL** field.

1. From the **Configuration** menu, select **Secret Server Connections**. The **Secret Server Connections** window will open.  
2. Click **Edit** text next to the Secret Server connection to be modified. (The Edit text will be between the Connection name and the URL value.) The connection dialog box will open.

**Note**: Users can make modifications to any of the fields here except for the Secret Server URL. If the Remember me option was selected previously, the user will not be able to change the Username value either. 

3. Make any desired changes in Step 1 and click **Connect**. 
4. Make any desired changes in Step 2 and click **Finish**. 

**Note**: A user may modify template selections at any time by selecting **Edit** next to the Secret Server connection.

# Secret Server Integration: How-To

Connection Manager integrates with Secret Server  version 10.7 or later, and requires a valid Secret Server license.

Since there are many variations and configuration options for remote connectivity, it is not possible to cover all of them in detail. However, Connection Manager does support many of these variations.
